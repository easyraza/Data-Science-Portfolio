**This README file provides an overview of a project that predicts house prices using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification. It details the data used, the model architecture, the training process, and the evaluation results.

Project Overview

This project aims to develop a model that can predict the price of a house based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and amenities. The model uses SVM classification, a machine learning technique known for its effectiveness in high-dimensional data with complex relationships.

Data Description

The project utilizes a dataset containing house price information and relevant features. You can specify the source of your data here, such as a specific housing market or a publicly available dataset like Kaggle's House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques. Mention the number of data points and the features used in the model.

Model Architecture

The chosen model is an SVM classifier. Briefly explain the reasons for choosing SVM, such as its ability to handle non-linear relationships and its robustness to outliers. You can also mention the specific type of SVM kernel used (e.g., linear, radial basis function) and any hyperparameter tuning performed.

Training Process

Describe the training process, including:

Data pre-processing: Mention any data cleaning or transformation steps applied (e.g., missing value imputation, feature scaling).
Train-test split: Explain how the data was divided into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Model training: Briefly summarize the training algorithm and any specific parameters used.**
