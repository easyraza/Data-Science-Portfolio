Sleep Stage Classification using SVM
This README file documents a project that uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify sleep stages from physiological data.

Data and Features:

The project uses the NewDataSet-10sAvg-equalsized.csv dataset containing 4872 samples of sleep stages (asleep, awake, light sleep) recorded every 10 seconds.
Features include average (AVG), standard deviation (STDDEV) of various physiological signals within each 10-second window.
Model Architecture:

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used for its effectiveness in high-dimensional data and non-linear relationships.
The specific SVM kernel and hyperparameters used can be mentioned here depending on your chosen configuration.
Preprocessing and Training:

Data is preprocessed by handling missing values and scaling features to a common scale using StandardScaler.
The dataset is split into training and testing sets with a 70/30 ratio.
The SVM model is trained on the training set.
Evaluation:

The trained model achieves an accuracy of 99.3% on the test set.
A classification report provides detailed precision, recall, and F1-score for each sleep stage.
A confusion matrix visualizes the model's performance in classifying true and false positives/negatives.
Conclusion:

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of SVM for sleep stage classification with high accuracy.
Further exploration could involve experimenting with different features, hyperparameter tuning, and comparing with other machine learning models.
Additionally, you can include:

References to any data source or tutorials used.
Code snippets for specific steps (optional if your code is already well-organized).
Visualization of the data or model predictions (e.g., sleep stage distribution).
Information about potential applications of the model (e.g., sleep monitoring systems).
