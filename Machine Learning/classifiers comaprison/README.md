Breast Cancer Classification with KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
This documents a project that compares and combines three machine learning models for breast cancer classification: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

Data:

The Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (569 samples, 30 features) is used for this analysis.
Methodology:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

scikit-learn's load_breast_cancer() function is used to load the dataset.
Features are scaled using StandardScaler.
Data is split into training and testing sets (70/30 ratio) for model evaluation.
Model Training and Evaluation:

KNN: Accuracy is evaluated for different values of k (1-5). The best performing k is chosen.
Decision Tree: Accuracy is evaluated for different maximum depths (1-4). The highest accuracy is used.
Random Forest: Accuracy is evaluated for different maximum depths (1-3). The best performing depth is selected.
Model Comparison and Ensemble:

The accuracies of all three models are compared on the test set.
A VotingClassifier ensemble is created using the best models for each individual algorithm.
The cross-validated accuracy of the ensemble model is calculated.
Results:

KNN: Best accuracy of 93% achieved with k=4.
Decision Tree: Highest accuracy of 93.7% obtained with a maximum depth of 2.
Random Forest: Achieved a best accuracy of 94.4% with a maximum depth of 3.
Voting Ensemble: Cross-validated accuracy of 95.2% demonstrates potential for improved performance compared to individual models.
Conclusion:

This analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest for breast cancer classification. Random Forest achieved the highest individual accuracy, while the Voting Ensemble showed promise for further improvement.

Additional Notes:

Code visualizations (e.g., accuracy vs. hyperparameter plots) can be added for clarity.
Cross-validation can be further explored with different folds or metrics.
Feature importance analysis could provide insights into the model's decision-making process.
